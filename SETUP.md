## Instructions for Building and Contributing

You require a [special build of asm6f](https://github.com/nstbayless/asm6f) which has support for patching directives. Make sure this version of `asm6f` is on the PATH.

Optionally, put [ipsnect](https://github.com/nstbayless/ipsnect) on the path to generate a patch map.

Finally, place your ROM into this directory and call it `base.nes`.

Then run `./build.sh`. `patch.nes` and `patch.ips` will be generated.

Do not commit any .nes files to the repo which are not in the public domain!
